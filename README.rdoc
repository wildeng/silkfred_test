I did this application as a test for an interview.

It basically parses a csv files which has two columns; in each column there is a url from which a picture can be downloaded.

The applications uses then delayed_job to parse the csv, to donwload the pictures to a temp file and then to create a photomontage using RMagick.

The public url of the photomontage is the saved in a CSV file so that it could be downloaded later.
